# Taskmaster Pro
Taskmaster Pro is a front end to-do application, which the user can create tasks with a description as well as a due date. They then can drag and drop their tasks in one of four boxes: 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'In Review', and 'Done'. The user can also drag and drop tasks to delete one task or can delete all tasks with a single button if they wish to do so.

## Features
1. User can create tasks with a description and a due date.
2. Users can drag and drop tasks in a box to help organize their individual tasks.
3. Users can delete either one task or all tasks at once.
4. Users can edit their tasks by clicking on them.
5. Tasks will color code themselves depending on the due date (yellow if the due date is coming up, red if the due date has past).


## User Story
As a user looking for a simple to-do list with a good looking UI and a good UX, I would like an application that allows me to create and organize my tasks so that I can easily see what I have to do. I want to be able to organize the tasks so I can see how far along they are. I would also like the application to show me which tasks are due soon or any due dates that I have missed. I want to be able to edit my tasks and their due dates or delete them altogether, either individually or all at once. The application should also save my tasks so that I can refresh or come back to the page at a later date.
